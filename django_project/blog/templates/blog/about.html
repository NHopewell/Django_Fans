        Hi there. Thanks for checking out Django Fans. 
        </p>
        <p>    
        This is a complete CRUD project that I wanted to do complete to improve my general development skills. I wanted to make some kind of forum 
        and I ultimately chose to make it about Django as that was the backend framework I used for the project.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to really improve my skills, I wanted to make this forum a lot cleaner than most forums 
        that other people list on their project portfolios. I wanted it to include some nice features one might expect from a proper forum they 
        frequent. Although I could certaintly add a lot more, some of these features include
        pagination, user authentication and profile updating, giving an authenticated user the ability to edit and remove their posts and comments, 
        allowing users to see all posts by themselves and other users, and just a generally nice layout. 
        </p>
